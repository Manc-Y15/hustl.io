# front-assets branch
This branch can be used as a common assets store. In order to maintain reusability in our CSS & JS assets, we can just add them to this branch instead of having conflicting asssets between front end branches.

## Asset Grid
The asset grid page file can be used to test & demonstrate different elements that can be used all around the site. It is best to refer back to it for design consistency.
