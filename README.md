## Contributing
New features should be made on separate branches per-feature as prescribed by the project board.
New branches preferably should follow name scheme `front-accountAuth` or `back-accountAuth`, prefix indicating frontend or backend.
To create a new branch from `main`, do `git checkout main`, then `git checkout -b branchName`
Once your feature is ready, or when workable enough to be added to the full project, submit a pull request from the pull requests tab.
