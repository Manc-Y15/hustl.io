Leagues Plan:

## Pages:
- [x] View all leagues
- [x] Create new league
- [x] League leaderboard w/ per-user management options (only shows if you're owner) and add user button
- [ ] Add user form (copy of friends page)
- [ ] User's portfolio for that league (copy of portfolio page)



## Modifications to existing pages:
- [ ] Change asset listing page to show balance on buy/sell + option to change portfolio to trade with
- [ ] Base layout navigation needs to be updated once we know which league pages are where
